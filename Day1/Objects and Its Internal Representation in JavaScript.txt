A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).

Example:Person,car,pen,bike,Computer etc.

1)Objects:
The following code assigns a simple value (Hero honda) to a variable named Bike:
Code:
var Bike = "Hero honda";
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The following code assigns many values (Hero honda, 2019, blue and soo on) to a variable named Bike:
Code:
var Bike = {Make: “Hero honda”, Model: “2019”, Color: “blue”, Fuel: "Petrol", Weight: “120kg”, Mileage: “68Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

Syntax:
var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.

2)Object Properties
The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
Code:
var Bike = {Make: “Hero honda”, Model: “2019”, Color: “Blue”, Fuel: "Petrol", Weight: “120kg”,Mileage: “68Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};

The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

Syntax to addig Property:
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
The syntax for deleting a property:
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
The syntax to access a property:
objectName.property
objectName["property”]    
objectName[expression] 
Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.
